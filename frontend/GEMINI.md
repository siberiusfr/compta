# Project Overview

This is a modern enterprise management application built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite. It's a single-page application (SPA) with a modular architecture, with separate modules for authentication, accounting, HR, and document management.

The application uses Pinia for state management, Vue Router for routing, and Naive UI for the component library. API interactions are handled by Axios and Tanstack Query, with API client code being generated by Orval from an OpenAPI specification.

The project is set up with a strong focus on code quality, with ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting, and Vitest for unit testing.

## Naming Conventions

-   **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.vue`)
-   **Files (TS/JS):** camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
-   **Stores:** `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuthStore`)
-   **Composables:** `use` prefix (e.g., `useAsync`)
-   **Types:** PascalCase (e.g., `User`, `ApiResponse`)

## API Client Generation

The API client is generated using Orval. To regenerate the client, run:

```bash
pnpm generate:api:all
```
